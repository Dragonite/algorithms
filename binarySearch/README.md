## Monotonic function

Binary searches assume **sorted** arrays. This means that as the index increases, the value will either stay the same, or increase or decrease, but not both. A monotonic function is a function f(x) that is non-decreasing or non-increasing, meaning it only moves in one direction.

Binary searches essentially find a **feasible** function to apply.
